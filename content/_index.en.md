# Bergen Open Source conference

Bergen Open Source is an annual tech conference in Bergen driven by students and other volunteers. The conference focuses on open source code and open data.

The first Bergen Open Source conference was held on November 2, 2023, with great success! You can read more about [the 2023 conference here](@/arkiv/2023/index.md). We are excited to invite you to this yearâ€™s conference, which will take place on November 7, 2024! The program is to be announced, so stay tuned for updates.

The conference was started by volunteers in [friByte][fribyte] with the goal of creating a meeting place for students and business life in Bergen. We want to create a conference that is available to everyone, and which can be an arena to learn away and inspire open source and open data.
