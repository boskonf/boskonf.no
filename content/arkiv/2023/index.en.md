Our very first conference was a great success with over 70 attendees and 5 exciting talks ranging from open source to open data. It was incredibly enjoyable to see so many former friByte members and brand new faces at the conference. We hope to see all of you again next year!

Here is the program for the conference, along with slides and video.
