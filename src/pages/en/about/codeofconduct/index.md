# Code Of Conduct

All attendees, staff and volunteers at the Bergen Open Source conference, as well as contributors to our open source software, are expected to follow this Code of Conduct.

## At the conference

We want the Bergen Open Source conference to be an enjoyable and welcoming event. All attendees, staff, speakers and volunteers are expected to behave respectfully towards others and show common courtesy.

Harassment of others, discriminatory actions, or behaviour that disrupts the conference will result in either a warning or removal from the event, depending on the severity. The board members of Bergen Open Source have full authority to remove any attendee who, within reason, violates these rules.

If you experience harassment, unwanted attention, or any other inappropriate behaviour, please contact one of the Bergen Open Source organizers.

## Contributing to our software

We welcome all kinds of contributions: code, documentation, design and ideas. Be respectful and helpful when discussing or suggesting changes.
