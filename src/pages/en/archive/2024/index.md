# 2024

In 2024 we organized Bergen Open Source for the second year in a row, and the conference was a huge success! Many thanks to everyone who participated. A lot of exciting knowledge was shared, and we hope it cultivated interest and motivation to dive further into the world of open source 🔍

There was a great atmosphere throughout the event, and we are proud to be part of such a committed, active and inclusive environment as open source is.

We would also like to thank the speakers who took the time to share their knowledge and experiences, and our dedicated friByte members for their efforts. This conference would not have been possible without you 🙌

We're already looking forward to seeing you next year 🚀

Here you can see the program for the conference, as well as slides and video.
